## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
We are predicting the traffic volume per day for the I94 interstate. The traffic volume per day is the number of cars which use the I94 interstate between St. Paul and Minneapolis. To make accurate forecasts, 6 models Average Model, Na誰ve Model, Drift Model, Holt Winter Model, Multiple linear regression and ARMA were used. The performance of the all models are compared and the best performing model is recommended to forecast traffic volume.

## Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify">
We are predicting the number of cars in a day on the I94 interstate between St. Paul and Minneapolis as shown in the below figure:

Business value of project:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Avoid Traffic Congestion: We can predict the days when there will be heavy traffic congestion and thus take contingencies to avoid them.</li>
<li>Road Maintenance: Using the traffic volume predictions we can estimate how long before the road needs repairs and we can schedule repairs when there is least traffic volume.</li>
</ol>
For achieving the goal of predicting traffic volume, we are considering 6 prediction models: Average, Na誰ve, Drift, Holt Winter, ARMA model and Multiple Linear Regression model.<br><br>
In average model, all the future predictions are average of the training data. In na誰ve model, we predict all the future values by taking the last value of the training dataset. In drift model, we plot a line from the first point of the data to the last point and extend it to predict all the future values. In the Holt Winter method, we will find whether traffic volume follows additive or multiplicative trend and then make predictions.
For the Linear Regression Model, we will scale the feature variables and perform data cleaning and then make predictions. Finally, for ARMA model, we will estimate the order of the ARMA process using GPAC table, estimate the parameters for ARMA and check whether the residuals pass the chi square test or not.<br><br>
Once all the models are created, we will compare the performance and recommend the best performing model.

## Data description

<div style="text-align: justify">
The dataset has hourly traffic volume from October 2012 to September 2018. Traffic volume is defined as count of cars in an hour on the interstate. As described previously, the hourly traffic volume is tracked between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN.

<br><br>
The dataset is sourced from the following website:<br>
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume

### a. Resampling strategy

<div style="text-align: justify">
For computational purposes and model interpretability the hourly data was resampled into daily data. Also, we are focusing on traffic volume data for September 2016 to September 2018.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
When we perform resampling the following functions were applied to the variables:
<ul>
<li>Mean: temp, clouds_all, traffic_volume, rain_1h, snow_1h.</li>
<li>First: weather_main, holiday.</li>
</ul>

After resampling the shape of the dataset is <b>(731,7)</b>.
